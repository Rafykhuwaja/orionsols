          <p className="text-lg">
            SEO is not only about ranking; It is about creating a spontaneous
            and pleasant experience for the user. Making your website faster,
            easier to use, and more accessible guarantees that visitors will be
            able to find out what they are looking at in a snap and without

            engagement, decreases bounce rates, and increases the possibility of
            repeating traffic. When customers have a good time on your website,
            they are more likely to become a lead or a customer. Additionally,

            Ignoring Mobile Optimization
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            There has been a lot of change in the rise of smartphones and mobile
            devices on how people reach the Internet. If your website is not
            favorable to mobile, then you are missing an important part of
            potential visitors. Google&apos;s mobile-first sequencing priority is for
            the mobile version of a site, which means that if your site is not
            mobile-friendly, your ranking will be damaged. Additionally, a poor
            mobile experience can result in high bounce rates, which negatively
            affect your SEO performance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            A mobile-friendly website ensures that users have an easy
            experience, whether they are browsing with desktops, tablets, or
            smartphones. This is important in today&apos;s digital scenario, where
            mobile traffic is a large percentage of all online activities.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-[#b8a9fe] text-2xl font-semibold">
            Not Using Proper Keyword Research
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Keyword research is the foundation of any effective SEO plan.
            Without proper keywords, your content potentially will not reach the
            intended audience or ranking for phrases that will bring organic
            traffic. Most sites err in targeting keywords that are too broad or
            too competitive, which could restrict their capacity to rank. Some
            people may recall the value of long-tail keywords, which have less
            competition and are more likely to fulfill users&apos; intention of
            searching.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            By conducting extensive keyword research, you can find keywords that
            are interesting to your audience, have sufficient search volume, and
            are not filled with competition. With the appropriate keyword
            approach, your site will rank for words that run highly relevant
            traffic, which will eventually lead to increased conversions
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-[#b8a9fe] text-2xl font-semibold">
            Duplicate Content Across Pages
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            The duplicate material is the same or highly similar material posted
            within a site or on more than one page within different sites. When
            the search engines detect duplicate materials, they may have trouble
            deciding which rank to give, so they can ignore both pages. This
            discovery can cause poor rank and visibility in results.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            To fix this problem, you need to either rewrite duplicate content to
            ensure that it is unique or the search engines will have to use a
            canonical tag to instruct which material you like. Auditing your
            website to check for duplicate material regularly is important to
            ensure that your content is original and is not damaging your SEO.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-[#b8a9fe] text-2xl font-semibold">
            Poor Internal Linking Structure
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Internal linking is the task of mentioning other posts or pages from
            your website. This matters as it indicates to find the structure and
            hierarchy of your site, thus, it becomes easier for them to crawl
            and index. A weak internal linking structure can make it impossible
            for both users and search engines to function, which can be harmful
            to your ranking.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            By having a rational internal linking scheme, you ensure that the
            major pages can be accessed quickly and the relevant related
            material is attached. It not only aids in SEO but also improves the
            user experience by directing users to other related content on your
            website.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-[#b8a9fe] text-2xl font-semibold">
            Missing or Poor Meta Descriptions and Titles
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Title and meta details are the first point of contact when they get
            the search engine results. These are very important to run click and
            increase the click-website of your website. Most websites fall into
            the trap of providing brand or non-existent meta details and titles,
            resulting in poor CTR and low visibility.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Creating special and interesting meta titles and descriptions with
            relevant keywords that accurately describe the page will make your
            site more visible in search results. A properly optimized meta title
            and description get users to click through to your site more,
            bringing more organic traffic.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-[#b8a9fe] text-2xl font-semibold">
            Not Optimizing Images
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Images are an essential component of any website, but if they do not
            adapt properly, they can greatly affect the page load time. Slowing
            the page load time can damage your SEO performance as search engines
            such as Google favor fast-loading sites. In addition, images that
            are not properly optimized with the Alt text can prevent the search
            engine from knowing what is in the image, making your site less
            visible in image search results.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            To correct for this, shrink images to lose file size yet maintain
            quality, and include detailed alt text that contains keywords
            relevant to the context. Optimised images enhance site speed, page
            SEO, and accessibility to users of all means.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-[#b8a9fe] text-2xl font-semibold">
            Slow Page Speed
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Page loading speed is an important aspect of both user experience
            and search engine optimization. The speed of the page is seen as a
            ranking signal by Google, so low rank of loading websites is less
            likely to rank. In addition, users leave a site. If it is slowly
            loaded, it creates a high bounce rate and lost traffic.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Enhancing the page speed of your site is a matter of image
            optimization, code minification, browser caching, and a high-speed,
            reliable host. Your website will deliver an enhanced user
            experience, make the visitors more interactive, and push your
            website up the rankings in search engines.

            Broken Links and 404 Errors
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Broken links and 404 errors happen when one of your pages is no
            longer accessible or the URL is wrong. They both adversely affect
            user experience as well as SEO. When search engines come to the
            broken link, they cannot manage your site&apos;s interpretation well, and
            it can damage your ranking. Similarly, when users encounter 404
            error pages, they leave your site; thus, your bounce rate increases.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            For broken links, it is mandatory to audit your website regularly
            and correct them. Software such as Fogs or Ahrefs can help you
            identify broken links and correct them to reconstruct them on the
            respective pages or to remove them.

            For companies relying on local customers, local SEO plays an

            As time passes, the material can become stale, which can lead to
            poor search performance due to not being refreshed. Search engines
